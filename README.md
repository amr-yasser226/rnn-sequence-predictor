# RNN Sequence Predictor

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the `SimpleRNN` layer to predict the next value in a sequence. It uses a synthetic sine wave dataset to demonstrate the model's ability to learn temporal patterns.

## Project Structure
- `notebook/rnn_sequence_prediction.ipynb`: The core implementation, optimized for execution on **Kaggle** or local environments.
- `report/main.tex`: Professional research report source.
- `report/main.pdf`: Compiled PDF version of the research report.
- `docs/assignment 3.md`: Original assignment instructions.

## Running on Kaggle
1.  Open [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2.  Click **Create** -> **New Notebook**.
3.  Upload the `notebook/rnn_sequence_prediction.ipynb` file.
4.  Ensure the environment has `tensorflow` and `matplotlib` (standard on Kaggle).
5.  Run all cells.

## Dataset
This project uses a **synthetic sine wave generator** within the notebook. For real-world experimentation, you can use datasets like the [Air Passengers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/air-passengers) on Kaggle.

## Report
The research report (`report/main.pdf`) provides a technical breakdown of the methodology, architecture, and results.
